# MEDIQA-CHAT-2023-NewAgeHealthWarriors
> Our team (NewAgeHealthWarriors) has worked on Task A and Task B. This readme will help you understand the problem statement, repo structure, how to run the code and generate output file via notebooks and shell script.

## Tasks
- **Task A - Short Dialogue2Note Summarization**: generating a section summary (section header and content) associated with the short input conversation. Section header will be one of twenty normalized section labels provided with the training data. 
- **Task B - Full Dialogue2Note Summarization**: generating a clinical note from the full input conversation. The note should include all relevant sections. Accepted first-level section headers are: "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS", "PHYSICAL EXAM", "RESULTS", "ASSESSMENT AND PLAN".

## How to run the task specific code and generate output file?
 > Running Jupyter Notebooks - For TaskA
  _(Run each of the mentioned notebooks in the order shown)_
  1. Run `notebooks/01-taskA-Classification_TraininingAndInference.ipynb` 
       - Output Generated = `output/final_taskA_classification_output.csv`
  2. Run `notebooks/02-taskA-SummarizationInference.ipynb`
       - Output Generated = ``
  3. Run `notebooks/03-taskA-SummarisationEnsemble.ipynb`
       - Output Generated = `output/final_taskA_summarization_output.csv`
  4. Run `notebooks/04-taskA-FinalOutputGeneration.ipynb`
       - Output Generated = `submission_output/final_taskA_output.csv`
 
 > Running Bash Script - For TaskA
  _(Run each of the mentioned shell scripts in the order shown)_
  1. Run `install.sh` 
  2. Run `activate.sh`
  3. Run `decode_taskA_run1.sh`
